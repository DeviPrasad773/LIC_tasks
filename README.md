Analysis of MOSFET Circuit Using LTspice

Introduction

This report presents a analysis of a simple MOSFET circuit using LTspice. The study includes DC operating point analysis, transient analysis, and AC frequency response over a broad frequency range.(0.1hz – 1Thz)

•	DC Analysis (Operating Point - .op)

In DC analysis we  will  determine the DC biasing conditions of the MOSFET, including drain current (Id), drain voltage (Vds), and gate voltage (Vgs).

•	Transient Analysis

Used to find Gain and to observe the time-domain response of the circuit when an AC signal (1 kHz, 50 mV peak) is applied to the gate along with a DC offset of 0.9V.

•	AC Analysis

Used to determine the frequency response of the circuit by performing small-signal AC analysis over a wide frequency range (0.1 Hz to 1 THz).

Questions For Understanding these analysis:


Q1)  i) Find DC operating point ii) Do transient analysis and find Gain iii) Do AC Analysis.
